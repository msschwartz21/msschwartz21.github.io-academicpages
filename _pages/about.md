I am a graduate student in the [Van Valen Lab](http://www.vanvalen.caltech.edu/) at Caltech. I am combining deep learning with molecular biology techniques in order to develop a method for creating spatial optical barcodes. My methodology will enable high throughput live cell library screens that will be cheaper and faster than existing techniques.

As an undergraduate, I worked with [Michael Barresi](https://sophia.smith.edu/blog/barresilab/) at Smith College. I developed a method for quantitatively comparing embryonic zebrafish forebrains.
